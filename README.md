# Solution Overview

The Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront solution helps to embed images on websites and mobile applications to drive user engagement. It uses [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/) to provide high-speed image processing without sacrificing image quality. To minimize costs of image optimization, manipulation, and processing, this solution automates version control and provides flexible storage and compute options for file reprocessing.

This solution automatically deploys and configures a serverless architecture optimized for dynamic image manipulation. Images can be rendered and returned spontaneously. For example, an image can be resized based on different screen sizes by adding code on a website that leverages this solution to resize the image before being sent to the screen using the image. It uses [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) for global content delivery and [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (Amazon S3) for reliable and durable cloud storage.

# Architecture Diagram

Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront supports two architectures: 

## ECS Architecture

One click deployment - https://solutions-reference.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront/latest/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront-ecs.template

![ecs-architecture](./ecs-architecture.png)

## Lambda Architecture

One click deployment - https://solutions-reference.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront/latest/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront-lambda.template

![lambda-architecture](./lambda-architecture.png)
_The Amazon API Gateway REST API architecture maintains the structure used in v6.3.3 and below of the Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront._

## S3 Object Lambda Architecture (DEPRECATED)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED: This architecture has been deprecated and should not be used for new deployments. Use the ECS Architecture instead.**

![Architecture Diagram (S3 Object Lambda Architecture)](./object_lambda_architecture.png)
> **The S3 Object Lambda architecture has been deprecated and will no longer be open to new customers starting on November 7, 2025. If you were not an existing user of S3 Object Lambda before November 7, 2025, select ‘No“ for EnableS3ObjectLambdaParameter. For more information, please visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/amazons3-ol-change.html.**  

The S3 Object Lambda architecture maintains very similar functionality, while also allowing for images larger than 6 MB to be returned. For more information, refer to the [Architecture Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/serverless-image-handler/architecture-overview.html) in the implementation guide.

# AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and [AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This solution uses the following AWS Solutions Constructs:

- [aws-cloudfront-s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-cloudfront-s3.html)
- [aws-cloudfront-apigateway-lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-cloudfront-apigateway-lambda.html)

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

# Customizing the Solution

## Prerequisites for Customization

- [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Node.js 20.x or later

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront.git
cd dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront
export MAIN_DIRECTORY=$PWD
```


### 2. Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests:

```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/deployment
chmod +x run-unit-tests.sh && ./run-unit-tests.sh
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/source/constructs
npm run clean:install
overrideWarningsEnabled=false npx cdk bootstrap --profile <PROFILE_NAME>

## deploy lambda architecture stack
overrideWarningsEnabled=false npx cdk deploy v7-Stack\
 --parameters DeployDemoUIParameter=Yes\
  --parameters SourceBucketsParameter=<MY_BUCKET>\
   --profile <PROFILE_NAME>

## deploy ecs architecture stack (see ./source/constructs/lib/v8/README.md)
overrideWarningsEnabled=false npx cdk deploy v8-Stack --parameters AdminEmail=<MY_EMAIL>
```

_Note:_
- **MY_BUCKET**: name of an existing bucket or the list of comma-separated bucket names in your account
- **PROFILE_NAME**: name of an AWS CLI profile that has appropriate credentials for deploying in your preferred region
- **MY_EMAIL**: email for the admin user who can configure origins, transformation policies and mappings

# Collection of operational metrics

This solution sends operational metrics to AWS (the “Data”) about the use of this solution. We use this Data to better understand how customers use this solution and related services and products. AWS’s collection of this Data is subject to the [AWS Privacy Notice](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/).
